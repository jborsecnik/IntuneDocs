# Remove devices by using factory reset, removing company data, or manually unenrolling the devicea

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

By using the **Remove company data** or **Factory reset** actions, you can remove devices from Intune that are no longer needed, being repurposed, or missing. Users can also issue a remote command from the Intune Company Portal to personally owned devices that are enrolled in Intune.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you remove a user from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), use the **Factory reset** or **Remove company data** actions for all devices that are associated with that user. If you remove users that have managed devices from Azure AD, Intune can no longer issue a factory reset or remove company data for those devices.

## Factory reset

The **Factory reset** action restores a device to its factory default settings. The user data is kept or wiped depending on whether or not you choose the **Retain enrollment state and user account** checkbox.

|Factory reset action|**Retain enrollment state and user account**|Removed from Intune management|Description|
|:-------------:|:------------:|:------------:|------------|
|**Factory Reset**| Not checked | Yes | Wipes all user accounts, data, MDM policies, and settings. Resets the operating system to its default state and settings.|
|**Factory Reset**| Checked | No | Wipes all MDM Policies. Keeps user accounts and data. Resets user settings back to default. Resets the operating system to its default state and settings.|

The **Retain enrollment state and user account** option is only available for Windows 10 version 1709 or later.

MDM policies will be reapplied the next time the device connects to Intune.

A factory reset is useful for resetting a device before you give the device to a new user, or when the device has been lost or stolen. Be careful about selecting **Factory reset**. Data on the device cannot be recovered.

### Factory reset a device

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Select **All services**, filter on **Intune**, and select **Microsoft Intune**.
3. Select **Devices** > **All devices**.
4. Select the name of the device that you want to factory reset.
5. In the pane that shows the device name, select **Factory reset**.
6. For Windows 10 version 1709 or later, you also have the **Retain enrollment state and user account** option. 
    
    |Retained during a factory reset|Not retained|
    | -------------|------------|
    |User accounts associated with the device|User files|
    |Machine state \(domain join, Azure AD-joined)| User-installed apps \(store and Win32 apps)|
    |Mobile device management (MDM) enrollment|Non-default device settings|
    |OEM-installed apps \(store and Win32 apps)||
    |User profile||
    |User data outside of the user profile||
    |User autologon|| 
    
         
7. To confirm the factory reset, select **Yes**.

If the device is on and connected, the **Factory reset** action propagates across all device types in less than 15 minutes.

## Remove company data

The **Remove company data** action removes managed app data (where applicable), settings, and email profiles that were assigned by using Intune. The device is removed from Intune management. This happens the next time the device checks in and receives the remote **Remove company data** action.

**Remove company data** leaves the user's personal data on the device.  

The following tables describe what data is removed, and the effect of the **Remove company data** action on data that remains on the device after company data is removed.

### Remove company data

1. Sign in to the [Intune in the Azure portal](https://aka.ms/intuneportal).
2. In the **Devices** pane, select **All devices**.
3. Select the name of the device from which you want to remove company data.
4. In the pane that shows the device name, select **Remove company data**. To confirm, select **Yes**.

If the device is on and connected, the **Remove company data** action propagates across all device types in less than 15 minutes.

## Delete devices from the Intune portal

If you want to remove devices from the Intune portal, you can delete them from the specific device pane. The next time the device checks in, any company data on it will be removed.

1. Sign in to the [Intune in the Azure portal](https://aka.ms/intuneportal).
2. Choose **Devices** > **All devices** > choose the devices you want to delete > **Delete**.

## Delete devices from the Azure Active Directory portal

You might need to delete devices from Azure AD due to communication issues or missing devices. You can use the **Delete** action to remove device records from the Azure portal for devices that you know are unreachable and unlikely to communicate with Azure again. The **Delete** action doesn't remove a device from management.

1.  Sign in to [Azure Active Directory in the Azure portal](http://aka.ms/accessaad) by using your admin credentials. You can also sign in to the [Office 365 portal](https://portal.office.com). From the menu, select **Admin centers** > **Azure AD**.
2.  Create an Azure subscription if you don’t have one. This shouldn't require a credit card or payment if you have a paid account (select the **Register your free Azure Active Directory** subscription link).
3.  Select **Azure Active Directory**, and then select your organization.
4.  Select the **Users** tab.
5. Select the user that's associated with the device that you want to delete.
6.  Select **Devices**.
7.  Remove devices as appropriate. For example, you might remove devices that are no longer in use, or devices that have inaccurate definitions.
